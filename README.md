# binary-search-tree

This is a python recreation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) with every method needed for OCR A-level Computer Science. </br>
It includes the methods of: </br>
- `preTraverse()` which carries out the preorder traversal of a BST (passing the left side of a node on a tree diagram)
- `inTraverse()` which carries out the inorder traversal of a BST (passing the under side of a node on a tree diagram)
- `preTraverse()` which carries out the postorder traversal of a BST (passing the right side of a node on a tree diagram)

As well as:
- `insert()` which inserts a new node into the tree and returns the value of said inserted node

All information relevant to this can be found in the [OCR specification](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/170844-specification-accredited-a-level-gce-computer-science-h446.pdf)
